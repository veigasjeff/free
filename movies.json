The film stars Sonam Kapoor as a blind woman who becomes the sole witness to a heinous crime. She must use her heightened senses to track down the killer and bring him to justice. The film begins with a young woman named Sophie being attacked and blinded by an unknown assailant. She is left for dead, but she manages to survive and eventually regains some of her sight. However, she is still severely visually impaired and must rely on her other senses to navigate. One day, Sophie is walking home from work when she witnesses a murder. She sees the killer's face, but she is unable to identify him. She reports the crime to the police, but they are skeptical of her story. They believe that she is mistaken or that she is making up the story for attention. Sophie is determined to find the killer herself. She uses her heightened senses to track him down, following his scent, listening for his footsteps, and even interpreting his body language. She eventually traces him to an abandoned warehouse. Sophie confronts the killer, but he overpowers her. He tries to kill her, but she manages to fight him off and escape. She runs back to her apartment and calls the police. The police arrive and arrest the killer. Sophie is hailed as a hero for her bravery, proving that even though she is blind, she is still capable of fighting for justice. She also becomes an inspiration to others who are visually impaired, showing them to never give up on their dreams. The killer is a man named Arjun, a wealthy businessman secretly involved in a criminal organization. He killed the victim because they knew too much about the organization's criminal activities. Sophie is able to track down Arjun by utilizing her other senses, following his scent to his apartment and listening for his footsteps when he leaves. She is also able to interpret his body language during their confrontation. The struggle between Sophie and Arjun is intense. While Sophie is able to fight back, Arjun eventually overpowers her. He attempts to strangle her, but she manages to break free and escape. Initially skeptical of Sophie's story, the police eventually believe her after she provides them with detailed descriptions of the killer and the crime scene. They are able to arrest Arjun and bring him to justice. Sophie's story is a testament that people with disabilities may face challenges, but they are still capable of achieving great things.

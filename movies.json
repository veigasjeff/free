He is quickly thrust into a high-stakes investigation when a Nigerian presidential assassination is linked to the CIA. Ryan uncovers a secret operation codenamed Pluto that was authorized by former CIA Director James Greer (Wendell Pierce). Pluto involved the CIA working with a drug cartel to smuggle weapons into Nigeria. The cartel then used the weapons to assassinate the president and destabilize the country. Ryan is determined to shut down Pluto and bring those responsible to justice. He teams up with Domingo Ding Chavez (Michael Peña), a fellow CIA agent, and Cathy Mueller (Abbie Cornish), a doctor who works with the CIA. The trio follows the trail of Pluto from Nigeria to Mexico to the United States. Along the way, they uncover a web of corruption and betrayal that reaches the highest levels of the US government. As Ryan gets closer to the truth, he finds himself in danger. He is targeted by assassins, framed for crimes, and even forced to go on the run. But Ryan is not easily intimidated.

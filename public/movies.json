The technology is still in its early stages, but the scientists are hopeful that it could one day be used to save the lives of loved ones who have passed away. The team of scientists is led by Dr. Emily Sanders (Kate Beckinsale), a brilliant but ambitious scientist who is determined to make the technology a success. She is joined by a team of experts, including Dr. David Palmer (James McAvoy), a bioengineer who is responsible for developing the technology; Dr. Sarah Walker (Jessica Chastain), a psychologist who is studying the psychological effects of the technology; and Dr. Mark Wilson (Chris Pine), a medical doctor who is responsible for overseeing the clinical trials. The team of scientists begins by testing the technology on animals, and they are initially successful. However, when they try to use the technology on humans, they encounter a number of problems. The first person they bring back to life is a young woman named Anna (Saoirse Ronan), who was killed in a car accident. Anna is initially confused and disoriented, and she has difficulty adjusting to life in the present day. She also begins to experience strange visions and hallucinations. The scientists are concerned about Anna's mental state, and they decide to put a hold on the clinical trials. However, Dr. Sanders is determined to continue her work, and she secretly brings back to life a man named John (Joel Edgerton), who was killed in a terrorist attack. John is initially grateful to be alive, but he soon begins to exhibit violent and erratic behavior. He also begins to have visions of the terrorist attack that killed him. The scientists are now faced with a dilemma. They know that the technology is dangerous, but they also believe that it has the potential to save lives. They must decide whether to continue with the clinical trials, even though they know that there is a risk of the technology being used for evil.    In the end, the scientists decide to destroy the technology. They believe that the risk of it being used for evil is too great. However, Dr. Sanders is not convinced. She believes that the technology could be used for good, and she vows to find a way to make it safe.",

    "synopsis": "Patrick is a young man from the Philippines who gets a visa to Japan in order to provide for his family. He works as a construction worker, but he is not earning enough money to support his family. He is introduced to the world of hosto, which is a type of gig economy work where men are paid to accompany women on dates. Patrick is initially hesitant to become a hosto, but he eventually agrees to try it out. Patrick quickly realizes that the world of hosto is full of indecent proposals. He is propositioned by women who are looking for more than just companionship. He is also subjected to groping and other forms of sexual harassment. Patrick tries to ignore these advances, but they become increasingly difficult to deal with. One day, Patrick is invited to a party by one of his clients. The party is full of wealthy businessmen and their wives. Patrick is offered drugs and alcohol, and he is encouraged to participate in sexual activities. Patrick refuses, and he leaves the party early. The next day, Patrick is fired from his construction job. He is unable to find another job, and he is forced to rely on his earnings from hosto to support his family. Patrick's situation becomes increasingly desperate, and he begins to spiral out of control. One night, Patrick is invited to a hotel room by a client. The client is a wealthy businessman who is known for his sexual appetite. Patrick is hesitant to go, but he eventually agrees. The businessman forces Patrick to perform sexual acts, and he threatens to kill Patrick if he tells anyone. Patrick is traumatized by the experience, and he begins to have nightmares. He also starts to experience physical symptoms, such as headaches and nausea. Patrick realizes that he needs help, but he is afraid to tell anyone what happened. One day, Patrick meets a social worker who is working with victims of sexual assault. The social worker helps Patrick to understand what happened to him, and she encourages him to report the crime. Patrick eventually decides to press charges against the businessman, and he is eventually convicted and sentenced to prison. Patrick's story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of the hosto industry. It is a reminder that even seemingly harmless activities can have serious consequences. It is also a story of hope, as Patrick is able to find the strength to overcome his trauma and rebuild his life.",

He is visited by his ex-wife Mia (Olga Kurylenko), who tells him that she has been offered a job to extract a woman named Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) from Bangladesh. Nik is a former CIA agent who is now being hunted by a group of mercenaries led by Zurab (Riz Ahmed). Rake agrees to help Mia, and the two of them travel to Bangladesh to rescue Nik. However, things quickly go wrong when they are ambushed by Zurab's men. Rake and Mia are forced to flee, and they take Nik with them.

It features Shahid Kapoor, Sanjay Kapoor, Diana Penty, Ronit Roy, Rajeev Khandelwal, Ankur Bhatia and Vivan Bhatena. It is the adaptation of 2011 French film Sleepless Night, which itself was remade in Tamil as Thoongaa Vanam (2015), starring Kamal Haasan. The film follows the story of Sumair Azad (Shahid Kapoor), a messed up, tenacious man who faces off against cops and crime lords to save the one relationship that matters to him: his son, Arjun (Agastya Nanda). Sumair is a former police officer who was framed for a crime he didn't commit. He was released from prison after serving five years, but he has never been able to clear his name. He now works as a private investigator, trying to make ends meet and provide for his son. One day, Arjun is kidnapped by Sikandar Chowdhary (Ronit Roy), a powerful crime lord. Sikandar is demanding a ransom of ₹100 crore, but Sumair refuses to pay. He knows that if he pays the ransom, Sikandar will just come back for more. Sumair decides to take matters into his own hands. He tracks down Sikandar and confronts him. A fight ensues, and Sumair is able to rescue Arjun. However, Sikandar is not finished yet. He vows to get revenge on Sumair and his family. Sumair and Arjun go on the run, trying to stay one step ahead of Sikandar's men. They are helped by a team of police officers, led by Inspector Khan (Sanjay Kapoor). However, Sikandar is a powerful enemy, and he is not going to give up easily. The film culminates in a showdown between Sumair and Sikandar. The two men fight to the death, and in the end, Sumair is victorious. He has saved his son, and he has finally cleared his name. Bloody Daddy is a fast-paced, action-packed thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is a story of love, loss, revenge, and redemption. Shahid Kapoor gives a powerful performance as Sumair, and the supporting cast is also excellent. The film is directed with flair by Ali Abbas Zafar, and the action sequences are well-choreographed. Bloody Daddy is a must-see for fans of action thrillers.",

    "head1": "Synopsis",
    "news1": "At this moment the whole world is thinking only about one thing, what is the role of Prabhas in Kalki 2898 AD, is it Kalki herself or Lord Shiva's incarnation Bhairava? Nag Ashwin himself gave the answer and also revealed the biggest hint of the film's story till date. Made such dangerous planning that your senses will be blown away. This is the biggest complaint of the fans about the makers of the film. They are not promoting it at the level it actually deserves, so the team of the film has silenced everyone by putting out a new promotional content. This is a sensible thing. For the sensible audience, a video named Prelude of Kalki has come which Actually it's like an introduction just before we step into Kalki's world and I'm sure. Believe the detailing with which Nag Ashwin is explaining each and every thing, on 27th June, Day One of Indian Cinema, all box office records finished RIP, first of all, watching this video will clear the doubts of those people who are thinking that That tomorrow's Adi Purush 2.2 is not going to be made, there are Boss God level visuals in this short video. \n\n A completely different world has been created, if your eyes tear up just after seeing the sketches, then what will happen in the theatre? Ashwin has started the video by saying that his film is like a sequel to Mahabharata, everyone knows what happened in Mahabharata and what next after that. The story of Kalki is going to start from here, the first scene of the film is probably Mahabharata. There will be a climax of the battle in which Lord Krishna himself can be seen. Yes, let me tell you an inside news, I have come to know that there are going to be not one, two, three but at least 15-20 small but powerful cameos inside Kalki. You should understand one thing very clearly that the character of Ashwathama is appearing again and again in the teaser trailer. The one who impressed everyone the most is only on 1. If we consider the actual film, it is not just Ashwat Dhama in the story. All the characters names you have heard in Mahabharata will be in the film. This is where point number two comes from when Nag Ashwin himself started his film. DC is calling it a competition to Hollywood giants like Marble Star Verse. There is overconfidence and not self-belief. They have confidence in their mythology and sci-fi topic due to which a film about a superhero's father has been made. Look, Nag Ashwin wants to give us in theaters what Ramayana and Mahabharata have been explaining to people for many years.   \n\n  The battle of good versus evil and this is where the biggest secret lies. He revealed this when he told that to end every war, a God incarnates who decides victory or defeat, just as Lord Krishna had defeated the Kauravas by supporting the Pandavas in the Mahabharata, but Kalyug is the same battle. It had already started in Kalki that the battle of Heroes vs Villains would be fierce. As it happens just before ending every era, understand Ramayana Mahabharata and 99 It is confirmed that in this battle, the one who is going to captain the heroes is Prabhas i.e. Bhairava who will be the incarnation of Lord Shiva, here Ashwathama will also be in his team along with others. All Chiranjeevis who have been blessed with immortality are the final battle of Kaliyuga. Kamal Haasan Sir will be the captain of the team of the opposite villain who will take part in it. Whether he is Asur Kali or not is a question of a different level, its answer will probably be found only in the theaters and when the final battle of Heroes vs Villains is going on, then this battle will take place. The 10th and last incarnation of Lord Krishna, Lord Kalki, will enter the Empire. This means bad. The news may be that in the first part of the Kalki film, we may not be told who is actually going to be Kalki.  \n\n  Part one of the project will end there when the whole world will come to know that Kalki has taken incarnation on earth. But his darshan will not happen before part two. Nag Ashwin is clearly telling about the fight. He will start Kalki in 2898 AD, Kalki will be brought into the film only to decide its climax, not before that. Now do not think that Prabhas's character has been wasted, his role is completely useless when he is not from yesterday. So how did he become the hero of this story? Have you read Mahabharata in TV serials? So you must have seen that Lord Krishna only shows the path and by following it, Arjun becomes the biggest hero of this fight. You understand that Prabhas is going to be the Arjun of this Kaliyuga, to show the path, Lord Kalki will be entered in the part two of the film. Actor Who Am I? I don't know at all who used to say this till today, not just Raja Mauli, Prabhas. Just like actors know how to use themselves, Prabhas's career will end without them. The way boss Nag Ashwin has planned to make Prabhas the biggest hero of Kalyug, it can be 10 times bigger than Baahubali. The fight of Baahubali is just Starts from the Kingdom of Mahishmati and ends in Kalki. Prabhas will fight for the whole world, do you understand? Well, one more thing that I have noticed in this video is that till now we are focusing only on the future, how the film will show the story of 500-600 years ahead but the real game of Nag Ashwin is in the past. They will also recreate the old era hidden in which there is a small hint of Amitabh Sir's Ashwathama. The look was that Nag Ashwin has spent 5 years in writing this film, what do you think, not just one part, the story will end within three hours, absolutely not, Kalki 2898 AD is just an introduction to the Kalki Universe, the next chapter of which will be the most important. Because Kalki will be standing there with Prabhas, come and see immediately. That Kalki's new video will make you understand why I am so excited about this film. This prelude video will make many people displeased with Bhairava Anthem. Be ready on 27th June. Dinosaur is coming. You may have liked something in the rest of the video or else. If you have any complaint then wait for me, I will meet you in the next video. take care bye bye",

    "news1": "Kabir Rishi, a chartered accountant, and his wife Jyoti live in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, with their two daughters, Janhvi and Dhruv. During a vacation at their isolated hill station home, they meet Vanraj Kashyap, an enigmatic figure. Vanraj gives Janhvi a laddu in exchange for her paranthas. After swallowing it, Janhvi begins to follow Vanraj's every instruction. Later, he offers her a packet of biscuits and instructs her to consume them when she arrives at the farmhouse. \n\n While relaxing in the farmhouse pool, Jyoti lays her wet phone in a rice box to dry. Vanraj comes at the door, stating that his phone's battery has died. Despite her concerns, Janhvi welcomes him enter. Vanraj talks to Janhvi about her life, generating family friction. When Dhruv interrupts jokingly, Vanraj directs Janhvi to threaten him, resulting in a deadly incident on the swing. Kabir and Jyoti intercede, insisting that Vanraj leave. He confesses that he entranced Janhvi with dark magic, forcing her to obey his every command. \n\n Vanraj's grip on Janhvi tightens, commanding her to damage phones, cut phone lines, and conduct odd deeds. Janhvi smacks her father under Vanraj's order. He demands Janhvi be turned over, threatens Dhruv, and instills fear.Jyoti calls the cops discretely. Vanraj threatens to have Janhvi ignite the gas cylinder if the truth is disclosed. The police depart unnoticed. Kabir gives Vanraj money to save them, but he burns it, showing his demonic nature and thirst for world dominance. Vanraj torments Janhvi, forcing her to self-harm and dance. He forces Janhvi to strip, which sparks Jyoti's attack. Kabir restrains Janhvi and confronts Vanraj, who tells her to laugh till she dies. \n\n Vanraj orders Janhvi to assassinate Dhruv, imprisoning her parents and following her. Dhruv survived the fall. Desperate, they agree to hand up Janhvi to Vanraj.Jyoti brings Dhruv to the hospital, while Kabir tracks for Vanraj's hiding place. He discovers Janhvi and the other captivated girls. Vanraj prepares for a ceremonial sacrifice. Kabir steps in, using Vanraj's recordings to release the ladies. The police successfully bring the girls home, but Vanraj flees.  \n\n A year later, Kabir insults Vanraj, who is being held hostage. He pledges to see Vanraj again, expressing his paternal authority. The terrifying story of Kabir Rishi and his family's meeting with Vanraj Kashyap at their rural farmhouse in Dehradun unfolds as a horrific tale of otherworldly influence and parental determination. What began as a peaceful family vacation quickly turned into a nightmare when they met Vanraj, a guy whose seemingly harmless actions of providing sweets to Janhvi in exchange for her meals revealed a dangerous power: the capacity to enslave minds by black magic.  \n\n As Vanraj's hold over Janhvi strengthened, so did the horror inside the Rishi family. Orders to break communication links and carry out unpleasant deeds arrived quickly, leaving Kabir and Jyoti anxious to defend their children from this terrible entity. The police's unintentional departure following a distress call further exacerbated their isolation and terror. Vanraj's true motives became obvious when he turned down Kabir's money offer, showing his demonic nature and megalomaniac ambition to conquer humanity. His psychological torment of Janhvi, which forced her to hurt herself and obey his every instruction, pushed the Rishis to their breaking point. Jyoti's brave attack on Vanraj, despite the risks, temporarily interrupted his control, but not before he ordered Janhvi to do a heinous crime on her own brother, Dhruv.  \n\n  The family's agony reached a climax when Kabir, motivated by his father's love and despair, followed Vanraj to his lair, where he found the magnitude of Vanraj's depravity: hundreds of brainwashed females, including Janhvi, were preparing for a ritual sacrifice. With ingenuity and bravery, Kabir exploited Vanraj's own recordings against him, liberating the girls from his evil influence and securing their safe return home thanks to police involvement. Despite Vanraj's escape, Kabir's resolve remained unwavering. A year later, he encountered Vanraj in captivity, ridiculing the now-voiceless man who possessed scary power. Kabir's ultimate act of disobedience highlighted a tragic truth: genuine power is found not in supernatural supremacy, but in unflinching love and protection for family. As he left Vanraj to his destiny, Kabir promised that their paths would cross again, exhibiting a firm conviction in justice and the strength of familial relationships.  \n\n  ",

    "news1": "Maidaan, At the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Indian national football team loses badly to Yugoslavia, 10-1. Members of the All India Football Federation blame Syed Abdul Rahim, the team's coach, for the dismal performance. Despite criticism, Rahim begs permission to assemble a new team with fresh talent. While other federation members, particularly Subhankar, are hesitant, Anjan, the federation's President, supports Rahim and gives him the necessary approval. \n\n Rahim goes on a countrywide hunt for great players, eventually assembling a squad that includes Tulsidas Balaram of Secunderabad, Peter Thangaraj of Hyderabad, and P. K. Banerjee and Chuni Goswami of Calcutta, among others. However, Roy Choudhary, a renowned journalist from Calcutta, bears a resentment against Rahim for picking only a few Calcutta players.  \n\n In the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, the Indian squad will meet Australia. An Australian player disrespects Neville D'Souza, who responds by scoring a hat-trick, propelling India to a surprise 7-1 win. The squad finished in fourth place, a remarkable accomplishment. Despite their achievement, Roy Choudhary and Subhankar plot to remove Rahim from his post.  \n\n At the 1960 Summer Olympics, the Indian team draws 1-1 with France, the world's top team, and fails to qualify for the next round. The federation eliminates Rahim as coach due to underperformance. Rahim is later diagnosed with lung cancer as a result of his smoking habit and is informed he has just a little time left.  \n\n Rahim is encouraged by his wife, Saira, to follow his ambition of leading the Indian team to a gold medal. He asks to coach the squad again, pledging to stand down permanently if he fails. Despite early opposition from Subhankar, now the President, Rahim obtains the backing of other federation members and is permitted to coach the squad once more. \n\n Rahim trains the squad for the 1962 Asian Games in Jakarta, despite budget difficulties. Rahim persuades Finance Minister Morarji Desai to grant financing on the condition that only 16 players, excluding his son Hakim, attend. Thangaraj, the squad's goalie, gets injured and replaced by Pradyut Barman, weakening the team. \n\n After losing their first match against South Korea, the squad, led by Rahim, regroups and learns the value of formation and cooperation. They beat Thailand 4-1, playing aggressively after teammate Jarnail Singh was hurt. An Indian diplomat's criticism of Indonesia's exclusion of Israel and Taiwan sparks demonstrations against the Indian delegation. \n\n On the day of the final match versus South Korea, the squad is targeted by protestors and requires military protection. Despite his declining health, Rahim gives an uplifting message to his team. His resolve wins over Roy Choudhary, who begins to support the squad. Thangaraj and Singh rejoin the squad, which wins the match 2-1, giving India its sole gold medal in football at the Asian Games. \n\n Syed Abdul Rahim's relentless devotion and strategic vision revolutionized Indian football, culminating in a historic triumph at the 1962 Asian Games.

    "news1": "Murder Mubarak, Netflix's latest murder mystery, is a riveting 142-minute story full of suspense, intrigue, and a stunning twist conclusion. Set against the sumptuous backdrop of The Royal Delhi Club, the film reveals the sinister side of its supposedly rich members. \n\n The story begins with the discovery of the dead corpse of Leo Matthews, the club's fitness trainer, who was brutally killed in the gym. This tragic act catches the attention of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Bhavani Singh and Sub-Inspector Padam Kumar, who are entrusted with solving the murder mystery.  \n\n As Bhavani and Padam dig deeper into the inquiry, they discover a slew of secrets that the club's members have frantically sought to conceal. The Royal Delhi Club, with its extravagant display of riches and power, is shown to be a front for a slew of illegal activities, including blackmail, drug addiction, and financial deception. The narrative unfolds when two more people, along with a cat, fall prey to the same unexplained circumstances that killed Leo. Bhavani is determined to reveal the culprit, thus the inquiry becomes increasingly urgent.  \n\n The investigation takes a dark turn when Bhavani hears about Guppie, one of the other murder victims, who was discovered attempting to melt the bones of a skeleton buried beneath a garden. Initially, club members speculated that the skeleton belonged to Ajay Kumar, the aggressive and drug-dealing husband of Ganga, the club maid. When Padam realizes Ajay is still alive, he disproves this hypothesis.  \n\n DNA investigation confirms that the skeleton belongs to Anshul, who was married to Bambi, one of the club's wealthiest and most colorful members. This revelation adds another layer of intricacy to the investigation, with Bhavani suspecting a deeper motivation behind the killings.  \n\n In a calculated effort, Bhavani seeks to blame Yash, another club member, for all three deaths. He fabricates a tale in which Yash, motivated by jealously, covertly taped footage of Bambi and murdered Anshul to eliminate his competitor. This created tale, on the other hand, is a brilliant attempt to compel a confession from the genuine offender. The disguise works, and Bambi, under duress, admits to the crimes. Her motive is based on a complex web of envy, greed, and a desperate attempt to preserve her opulent lifestyle. Bambi's arrest puts the inquiry to a dramatic finish, with law enforcement finally apprehending \n\n Murder Mubarak is a masterpiece in suspense, combining complex human interactions with a narrative that keeps viewers guessing until the very end. The film's treatment of topics such as greed, deception, and the veneer of prosperity enriches its compelling story. The surprising conclusion not only shocks but also ties together the story's many hints, making it a must-see for genre enthusiasts.  \n\n Murder Mubarak stands out as a riveting addition to Netflix's murder mystery repertoire, thanks to superb performances, particularly from the actors portraying ACP Bhavani Singh and Bambi. The film not only entertains, but it also raises questions about the extent people will go.  \n\n ",

    "news1": "Halo Season 2 is shaping up to be a watershed moment for fans of the renowned game franchise, promising to dig further into the massive universe created by Bungie and 343 Industries. Set against the background of Reach, one of humanity's final strongholds and a key defense against Covenant troops, Master Chief and his Spartan-II battalion face their most dangerous challenge yet. \n\n The first season of Halo established a solid foundation, introducing viewers to the mysterious Master Chief, his origins as a supersoldier, and the intricate dynamics of humanity's conflict with the alien Covenant. Showrunner Steven Kane left after the first season, allowing David Wiener to take over. Wiener, known for his work on dystopian tales such as Brave New World and the suspenseful thriller Fear the Walking Dead, appears to be involved in season 2, implying a change toward a grittier and more dramatic storytelling style.  \n\n Production on Halo season 2 began in September 2022, indicating a commitment to expanding on the visual and narrative realm established in the first season. Recent disclosures from exclusive posters received by GamesRadar+ depict Master Chief and his Spartan-II teammates from the Silver Team surrounded by Covenant Elites holding Energy swords. This visual not only foreshadows huge clashes, but also demonstrates the series' commitment to bringing the game's dramatic combat to life on screen. \n\n  The show's growth offers more than simply action scenes. It intends to enrich character arcs, investigate moral quandaries, and build on the rich history that has enthralled players for decades. Master Chief's voyage, in particular, is planned to explore themes of responsibility, sacrifice, and the human condition set against the background of interplanetary conflict. \n\n Fans of Halo season 2 are eagerly awaiting information on its release date and how to get it on Paramount Plus. The platform's global reach allows viewers to immerse themselves in Master Chief's unending quest to preserve mankind from existential dangers. \n\n Beyond the action-packed fights and spectacular visuals, Halo season 2 is set to delve into deeper tales, pulling inspiration from the huge Halo world while offering new twists and challenges for its favorite characters. As the series prepares to debut its second chapter, fans are eager to see how it will build on its predecessor's triumphs while also venturing into unexplored narrative terrain. \n\n As fans wait down the days before its debut, Halo season 2 promises to be a must-see for both longtime fans and newbies, providing a unique take on one of gaming's most beloved sagas via the lens of episodic television.",

DC Hana Li (Jing Lusi), a London police officer who dislikes the duty, is tasked with accompanying him. Hana's initial apathy to Nolan and his suffering is immediately reversed when a fatality happens on their journey, journey 357. The murder signals the start of a terrible plot that endangers everyone on the flight. \n\n As the dead count grows, Hana understands that the scheme is far more than a simple extradition. She must negotiate a maze of lies and peril, protecting Nolan while discovering the truth. Her police instincts kick in, and what began as a regular escort operation quickly evolves into a battle for life against invisible foes.  \n\n Back in London, Hana's sister, Jess (Jemma Moore), a determined journalist, launches her own inquiry into Nolan's case. Her tireless quest of the truth reveals links that go well beyond Nolan's current problems, involving powerful personalities and exposing hidden intentions. Jess' findings not only give critical information, but they also put her in great danger. \n\n Madeline Delaney, the chief of MI5, is dragged into the catastrophe as it unfolds. Delaney, played by an as-yet-unknown outstanding actress, is a seasoned operator who must strike a balance between her responsibility to her nation and her desire to safeguard Hana and Nolan. Delaney uncovers a scheme involving not just China but also high-ranking individuals from her own country. The stakes are high, and her careerâ€”and lifeâ€”is on the line. \n\n To summarize, Red Eye 2024 is a great combination of mystery, action, and drama. It delves into the depths of human resiliency and the complexity of world politics. The story's deep character development, paired with its fast-paced narrative, make for an outstanding cinematic experience. As secrets are revealed and alliances alter, fans are kept wondering until the last, heart-pounding scene. \n\n  ",

    "news1": "Sunflower's highly anticipated second season expands on the quirky murder investigation with new characters and unexpected twists. The police pair DG (Ranvir Shorey) and Tambe (Girish Kulkarni) are back, determined to find Mr. Kapoor's (Ashwin Kaushal) killer. Their inquiry takes them through a tangle of suspicions and secrets, with the Sunflower Society at the center of everything. \n\n This season takes a dramatic turn with Ahuja's (Mukul Chadda) confession, which generates more questions than answers. Ahuja's admission of guilt complicates the inquiry, causing both police and viewers to question his motivations and the veracity of his confession. Is Ahuja actually to blame, or is there more to the story?   \n\n The narrative intensifies with the arrival of Rosie (Adah Sharma), a seductive bar dancer who inherits Kapoor's lavish apartment. Rosie's surprising entrance into the Sunflower Society raises new questions and suspicions. Her enigmatic history and unexpected inheritance make her a focal point in the investigation, attracting the interest of both townspeople and police. \n\n  Sonu (Sunil Grover) and Rosie build a growing romance as the story unfolds. Sonu, the simpleton inhabitant who unwittingly became the main suspect in the previous season, is caught up in a confusing relationship. As Sonu and Rosie's love and passion grow, their changing connection gives emotional depth to the story. However, it complicates the inquiry since emotional sentiments begin to interfere with the search for the truth. \n\n The second season has more interesting people, each with their own secrets and probable motivations. As the number of suspects expands, the police struggle to discern fact from fiction. The residents of the Sunflower Society, each with their own peculiarities and secret intentions, complicate the situation. With each revelation, the inquiry takes a new turn, putting spectators on the edge of their seats. \n\n The underlying issue remains: Will DG and Tambe be able to find the true culprit, or will they continue to be duped by red herrings and false leads? The second season of Sunflower aims to resolve some of these burning questions while leaving plenty unanswered to keep the viewers guessing. The show's eccentric, unexpected character guarantees that each episode is full with shocks and twists. \n\n Sunflower 2 continues to combine comedy and tension, resulting in a unique viewing experience. The housing society environment creates a microcosm of different characters and interpersonal relationships, making the murder investigation all the more intriguing. Sonu's innocence and naivety, contrasted with the cunning and treachery of other characters, weave a beautiful tapestry of storytelling. \n\n As the season develops, viewers will be lured further into the world of the Sunflower Society, eager for each new development. The interplay between the characters, the blossoming romance, and the unwavering quest of the truth make Sunflower 2 an engaging watch. The combination of comedy, drama, and mystery ensures that this season meets the expectations established by its predecessor, providing a satisfying yet open-ended resolution to the core enigma. \n\n Finally, Sunflower 2 is a compelling continuation of the bizarre murder investigation that began in the first season. With more characters, deeper connections, and more complicated plot twists, this season promises to keep fans engaged from beginning to end. Will the police ultimately capture the true culprit, or will the mystery remain unsolved? Tune in to find out.",

    "news1": "In the third season of UNDEKHI (UNà¤¦à¥‡à¤–à¥€), director Ashish Shukla masterfully weaves a complex narrative that delves deep into the corruption and brutality of the upper class. The Atwal family's grip on power remains unchallenged, as they crush their enemies with impunity. This bold portrayal of brutal injustice is underscored by a justification matrix that is as undekhi (unseen) as the title suggests. It's almost as if a member of the Atwal family themselves crafted this gripping series. \n\n The season opens with a poignant and ironic scene: a policeman from DCP Ghosh's team is killed under mysterious circumstances. Immediately following this, the Atwal mansion erupts in celebration with traditional Punjabi drums, creating a stark and tragic juxtaposition. This scene sets the tone for the entire season, highlighting the irony and tragedy at the heart of the series.   \n\n Rinku (Surya Sharma) emerges as a central figure, driven by a desire for revenge and a need to restart his illegal drug business. Amidst this chaos, a video of Papaji (Harsh Chhaya) murdering a dancer at a wedding surfaces, becoming the pivotal evidence that reopens the case against the Atwals. DCP Ghosh (Dibyendu Bhattacharya) seizes this opportunity, hoping to bring justice for the dead girl and dismantle the Atwal empire. \n\n  However, the path to justice is fraught with obstacles. Rinku faces the daunting task of protecting his father, Papaji, from the law. Trust becomes a scarce commodity as everyone, including Papaji's son Daman (Ankur Rathi) and daughter-in-law Teji (Aanchal Ji Singh), pursues their own agendas. Daman and Teji seek investors for their resort and dream of escaping abroad, while Teji's friend Saloni (Ann Zoya), the sole surviving witness of the wedding murder, thirsts for revenge. \n\n Director Ashish Shukla introduces new characters, adding layers of complexity to the narrative. Rajeev Malhotra (Varun Badola), aiming to expand his illegal business in Manali, faces new challenges alongside his ruthless manager, Deepika (Shruti Menon). The intertwined fates of these characters make it difficult to keep track of their shifting alliances and betrayals. \n\n Despite the slow pace of the murder investigation, which creates a sense of impending injustice, the stunning natural beauty of Manali provides a striking backdrop to this crime thriller. Harsh Chhaya's portrayal of the crude and alcoholic Papaji is a standout performance, infusing the character with a blend of menace and dark humor. His repetitive yet captivating actions anchor the series, while Surya Sharma's Rinku shows unexpected emotional depth, especially in scenes with his wife Muskaan (Shivangi Singh). \n\n Dibyendu Bhattacharya delivers a strong performance as the relentless DCP Ghosh, supported by the excellent portrayals of Satinder (Rahul Bagga) and Raashi (Lavina Tandon) as part of his investigative team. Varun Badola's portrayal of Rajeev Malhotra adds intrigue to the series, though the roles of Daman and Teji could have been streamlined. \n\n The series effectively captures the viewer's attention with Papaji's mysterious past and the unfolding chaos. The director brilliantly juxtaposes the heinous actions of influential people with moments of dark humor, creating a visceral reaction in the audience. A particularly memorable scene occurs in episode seven, where Rinku, Teji, and DCP Ghosh unite against a common enemy with a heroic background score, blurring the lines between good and evil. \n\n In a climactic moment, ultimate enemies Ghosh and Rinku find themselves out of bullets and forced to work together. This duality reflects the series' core theme: good and evil are two sides of the same coin. The director refrains from passing judgment on the characters, presenting the story as a chilling yet entertaining anecdote. \n\n Season 3 of UNDEKHI (UNà¤¦à¥‡à¤–à¥€) remains true to its legacy, showcasing the consistent ruthlessness of Harsh Chhaya's Papaji. His performance, marked by physical labor and a deeply uncomfortable posture, is a testament to his dedication to the role. The Atwal family's quest for revenge uncovers buried secrets, deepening the intrigue and danger in Manali. \n\n As with previous seasons, UNDEKHI (UNà¤¦à¥‡à¤–à¥€) Season 3 explores the bloody games played by its characters to fulfill their selfish desires. The series remains a gripping exploration of power, corruption, and the dark side of human nature, set against the stunning yet treacherous backdrop of Manali.",

    "news1": "Crew 2024 is a riveting thriller about three hard-working women who become entangled in a web of deception, desperation, and peril. Their fates connect as they traverse improbable scenarios, resulting in an explosive story of survival and intrigue. \n\n The narrative starts with a sense of urgency and dissatisfaction. 'Where's the gold?' Where's the gold? Gold? 'Gold? Gold?' is a frantic scream for money and security, which appear to be ever-elusive. The entrance of Vijay Walia, Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines, sets the tone for the battle. He tells the workforce, We want to bring everyone onboard. Hello, My name is Vijay Walia. Chairman of Kohinoor Airlines. When will we receive our salaries? We'll get all of our overdue bills paid next week thanks to the Diwali bonus. But the doubt is palpable: We won't even get a box of sweets for Diwali, and you're dreaming of a bonus. \n\n  Jasmine, one of the major protagonists, is going through her own challenges. 'You haven't paid the rent for six months,' she is reminded. She thinks on her years of hard labor and feels deceived by the system: We worked like maids for 20 years. We allowed them to deduct their taxes. Then the provident fund. We let them screw us over. 'Is our company bankrupt?' Mr. Bindra confirms the terrible truth, asking, 'Madam, what are you saying? Swear to Mother Goddess, Mr. Bindra. We are bankrupt. I swear to God, we're bankrupt.' \n\n  In this time of financial disaster, Rajvanshi sir begs Jasmine to exhibit kindness. But desperation promotes audacity. 'Scoundrel. Will we keep it? Are you out of your mind? 'If we are caught, they will ban us from the airport, let alone an airplane,' she claims. The disclosure of hidden money raises tension: Mr. Mittal, you turned out to be such a sly man. We don't have enough money to purchase cookies, but you're making a fortune. \n\n The trio considers the unfathomable. 'Help us, too, sir. Will you be able to accomplish it? We're going to live it up today like the wealthy.' However, their scheme is dangerously close to failure. 'Where are you going?' To do an unusual dance. I want to see. Comedy? Someone knows about us. The meeting with customs is nerve-racking. 'What are you doing here?' -Customs. Customs? What's inside the bag? Shit.  \n\n  The film depicts the metamorphosis that money may cause. 'Sethi, ma'am.' Money may transform anyone into a gangster. How does he simply get away? 'Because he is rich, baby.' The catastrophic repercussions of inequality are well demonstrated. 'Oh, shit.' Take a look at Titanic. The wealthy escaped on boats. Who had to drown? The department has received some type of tip. You're going nowhere, lady. I'm afraid. Then sing. Which one? 'Gold. 'So much gold.' \n\n  Amidst the pandemonium, Geetu, a competent pilot, is caught in a moral quandary. Geetu. You're a talented pilot who excels at everything. But I can't do it. 'Fly the airplane.' The stakes are high as they await confirmation of the tip: 'Is the tip confirmed?' Solid. 'Does the jail have internet?' \n\n As tensions rise, their destiny hangs in the balance. 'Please take a seat, sir.' They said they were preparing for an arrest. Arrest? You. 'Sit, moron.' Fear, courage, and the unwavering desire of a better life propel the story to its climax.  \n\n Crew 2024 is a compelling narrative of tenacity and the lengths regular people will go when pushed to their limitations. It emphasizes the plight of individuals stuck between economic disparities and the hazardous attraction of quick money. Through comedy, suspense, and raw emotion, the film creates a realistic image of survival in a society where the line between good and wrong is frequently blurred.",

    "news1": "In Bade Miyan Chote Miyan 2024, two elite troops, each with a tragic background, are sent on a risky mission to protect India from a masked maniac intent on destruction. The stakes are sky-high as a nameless, faceless criminal steals the most lethal weapon ever developed in the country, endangering national security and world peace. \n\n  The villain's terrifying pronouncement sends shivers down the spine: 'The most dangerous enemy is the one who does not fear death.' An enemy without a name, identity, or face, whose sole goal is... revenge. With a chilling malice, he taunts, 'Who are you?' Doom. I'm taking something valuable from you all... I hope you do not mind. \n\n  The desperation is evident. The package is the most potent and lethal weapon ever produced in our country. The world has never witnessed a greater battle. You have three days. You must act soon! As terror increases, the only hope is to send two troops who can match the villain's lunacy and fearlessness. 'To catch this psychopath, we'll need two even larger psychos. We possess the heart of a soldier. And the mind of a demon. Beware of us. Because we are India!' \n\n Our heroes, elite troops with opposing personalities, must work together. 'I'll cover the north, you handle the east,' one orders. The other responds, 'Why would you lead?' The tension is great, but the first soldier insists, 'Because I am the best.' Their contrasts are stark: one is seasoned and mature, while the other is youthful and dynamic; one is powerful and a perfectionist, while the other is quick and fierce. Despite their disagreements, they must find a way to work together.  \n\n  Their goal is hampered by their squad, which includes Captain Misha, a seasoned operator, and Pam, an IT Specialist and covert asset. They work together to trace down the stolen cargo, which ends up in an underground vault in London, setting up a worldwide clash. \n\n  However, the mission is beset with internal turmoil. 'Why don't you both follow orders?' their boss asks. One soldier acknowledges, 'My ego is bigger than my talent,' while another mocks, 'His biggest talent is his ego.' However, they must transcend their differences as the villain's menace grows: The entire of India will bear the repercussions for what you did to me. You believe you are really heroes? 'Try to stop me.' \n\n As they face their adversary, the warriors say, 'This battlefield might be yours... But we are the oldest participants in this game. The name of our regiment is Lions. Long live India!' Their commitment is unwavering. 'The more wounded a soldier of this regiment getsâ€¦ The more dangerous he becomes.' \n\n The climax is a showdown of wits, strength, and endurance. 'We are very old friends...' We may give and steal each other's life. The soldiers' friendship, formed in the embers of previous fights, is their most valuable asset as they face the disguised villain in a lethal encounter. \n\n The action in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan 2024 is unrelenting, the stakes are tremendous, and the characters' friendship highlights the story's heart. It's an action-packed thriller that highlights the bravery, friendship, and unwavering resolve of two soldiers trying to preserve their country.",

    "news1": "Four years after the tragic death of Isabel Aretas, Detective Mike Lowrey finds a new beginning in his life by marrying his physical therapist, Christine. Their wedding, however, takes an unexpected turn when Mike's partner, Detective Marcus Burnett, suffers a mild heart attack during the ceremony. This health scare sends Marcus into a coma, where he experiences a profound vision of their late captain, Conrad Howard. In this vision, Howard reassures Marcus that his time has not yet come, instilling in him a renewed sense of invincibility upon waking. \n\n Once Marcus regains consciousness, he interprets his vision as a sign that he is invincible. Shortly after, a scandal erupts in the media, revealing that Captain Howard was allegedly involved in corruption with drug cartels. Determined to clear their mentor's name and restore his tarnished legacy, Mike and Marcus embark on a mission to uncover the truth. They are joined by Captain Rita Secada and her new boyfriend, mayoral candidate Adam Lockwood, in their quest for justice. \n\n  Their investigation leads them to visit Mike's son, Armando Aretas, who is serving time for Howard's murder. Armando reveals a crucial piece of the puzzle: Howard was never corrupt, but he was on the verge of exposing those who were. The corrupt officials, fearing exposure, hired Armando and his mother to kill Howard. Armando, seeking redemption, offers to help Mike and Marcus identify the true culprits behind Howard's murder. \n\n  As the trio delves deeper into the conspiracy, they discover that the conspirators are attempting to access Howard's computer. However, a fail-safe mechanism triggers a pre-recorded video sent to Mike and Marcus, warning them about widespread corruption within federal and state law enforcement. In this video, Howard uses the code phrase 'Coke bottle,' leading them to their former hacker colleague, Fletcher. At Fletcher's club, they retrieve a QR code hidden in wall art, unlocking a second video from Howard. However, their success is short-lived as assassins track them down and kill Fletcher. \n\n Meanwhile, Armando faces his own peril as he is attacked by fellow inmates posing as prisoners. Displaying his formidable combat skills, he manages to eliminate them all. Mike and Marcus arrange for Armando to be airlifted to a more secure location in Miami, but the conspirators strike again, causing the helicopter to crash. Despite the crash, Mike, Marcus, and Armando survive, only to find themselves branded as fugitives.  \n\n  With a bounty on their heads, the trio is hunted by law enforcement and criminals alike. Amidst this chaos, U.S. Marshal Judy Howard, Conrad's daughter, vows revenge on Armando for her father's death. The tension escalates as AMMO team members Dorn and Kelly assist Mike, Marcus, and Armando in decoding the clues left by Howard. They uncover that a former Army Ranger turned DEA agent, James McGrath, is the mastermind behind the corruption. McGrath, once tortured by the cartel into betraying his associates, has since become a cartel boss himself. \n\n  The stakes reach their zenith when McGrath kidnaps Christine and Callie, Judy's daughter. He also targets Marcus's family, but Reggie, Marcus's Marine son-in-law, successfully defends them. The team exposes Lockwood as McGrath's accomplice and uses him as bait to rescue the hostages at a dilapidated alligator-themed amusement park. \n\n In a climactic showdown, Lockwood meets a grisly end, devoured by an alligator after attempting to double-cross the team. Mike confronts McGrath, who forces him into a deadly choice between Christine and Marcus. Mike, leveraging Marcus's belief in his invincibility, shoots Marcus in his bulletproof vest, creating an opportunity for Christine and Marcus to break free. In the ensuing chaos, Mike kills McGrath. Judy, meanwhile, prepares to kill Armando but is stopped by Callie, who reveals that Armando saved her life. Judy, reluctantly grateful, spares Armando and lets him escape.  \n\n With the corruption exposed and their names cleared, Mike and Marcus celebrate their victory and newfound freedom. The duo, along with Reggie, cooks food on a public grill, basking in the simple joy of a job well done and the bonds of family and friendship.",

    "news1": "Madgaon Express 2024 depicts the humorous and chaotic story of three childhood friends who go on a long-anticipated journey to Goa. Their enthusiasm is apparent as they go on what they hope would be the experience of a lifetime. They had no idea that their voyage is going to take an unexpected turn. \n\n  'I wanna go to Goa,' one of them exclaims. It's our time! If not now, when? 'After college?' The excitement is palpable as they finally decide to take the trip they've been planning for years. At 21 years old, they've never left Bombay, and the prospect of leaving parental tension behind and establishing their maturity makes them ecstatic. We aren't kids anymore! We are grownups. 'Goa, here we come!' they exclaim, ready to have as much fun as they had on their previous trip. \n\n  However, problems arise right away. One of the companions complains, 'This is unsanitary.' I am allergic. Do you want to torment us? Make us sit in a non-air-conditioned compartment? 'If he dies, what will we tell his mother?' 'Another, more positive, responds, 'Why would I die? The Madgaon Express from Mumbai to Goa offers one of the world's most magnificent sights.' The doubtful companion responds, 'You gonna show us scenic views at night?' 'With a torch?' \n\n As night strikes, the train trip grows increasingly weird. In an unexpected twist, they meet a fascinating stranger. 'Are you a prostitute?' one buddy asks, to which the visitor responds angrily, 'What!' No! My buddies are narrow-minded. 'I prefer...'. Chaos erupts as another acquaintance begins slurring, 'My tongue has gone numb.' 'I can't speak properly.' The terror builds when someone yells, 'Cocaine! Cocaine!' followed by a bewildered, 'Totaine?' What? You mean there's a lot of totaine in the bed?  \n\n  The scenario quickly escalates. OPEN UP! Goa Police. 'Where is my stuff?' asks a harsh voice, while another figure moans, This is one awful rifle! The stuff is mine, and I am taking it. The guys become involved in a labyrinth of cops, criminals, and narcotics, completely perplexed. 'What's going on?' one exclaims. Another reassures, Do not be afraid. I am there. I will take care of you. \n\n The tension reaches a climax with a comical mix-up. I adore Goa. You have 10 minutes, Rambo! 'Don't act tough under the influence,' one friend mocks as they confront the thugs. The criminals' leader, Don Mangola, is mistakenly referred to as Don Mandolin, to which he answers angrily, 'Let us go, brother Mandakini.' Incredulous, the companions chuckle, Mandakini? 'Do I resemble the film heroine to you?' \n\n With each twist and turn, their journey becomes a comic nightmare. 'We couldn't ever get to Goa, and now we can't get out,' one buddy laments. In the midst of the turmoil, they even find themselves in an unusual circumstance in which they must 'walk like a woman and push those oranges up.' They keep falling down.  \n\n Madgaon Express 2024 is a chaotic voyage full of fun, uncertainty, and unexpected surprises. It encapsulates the spirit of young adventure and the unexpected unpredictability of life. As the companions negotiate the chaos, they realize that sometimes the trip is more memorable than the goal.",
